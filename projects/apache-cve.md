# Mini Project – Apache CVE Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This mini project focuses on understanding and exploiting a **known Apache web server vulnerability** in a controlled lab environment.  
The goal was to simulate a **realistic vulnerability assessment workflow**, not just exploit execution.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the root cause of the vulnerability
- Analyze the affected Apache configuration
- Reproduce the issue in a safe environment
- Study real-world impact and mitigation

---

## 🧠 Technical Approach

### 1️⃣ Reconnaissance
- Identified Apache version and exposed services
- Mapped attack surface related to the vulnerable component

### 2️⃣ Vulnerability Analysis
- Studied CVE details and exploitation conditions
- Understood why the misconfiguration exists

### 3️⃣ Proof of Concept
- Verified vulnerability in a local lab setup
- Observed attacker impact without causing damage

---

## 🛡️ Mitigation & Defense
- Apache version patching
- Secure configuration practices
- Monitoring and logging recommendations

---

## 📘 Key Learnings
- Importance of **version management**
- How misconfigurations become real attack vectors
- Difference between theoretical CVEs and practical exploitation
- Thinking from both **attacker and defender perspectives**

---

## 🔒 Ethical Note
All testing was performed in a **controlled lab environment** for educational purposes only.
