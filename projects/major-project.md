# Major Project – Cloud Exposure to Application Compromise

## 📌 Title

**Cloud Exposure to Application Compromise:  
Attack Path Discovery and Exploitation Framework**

---

## 🧭 Status

🚧 **In Progress**  
(Current phase: architecture design & attack path modeling)

---

## 🔍 Motivation

Modern attacks often begin with **cloud exposure**, not traditional application vulnerabilities.

Examples include:
- Exposed cloud resources
- Leaked credentials or tokens
- Over-privileged identities
- Weak authorization boundaries

This project focuses on **attack path discovery**, modeling how attackers move from **cloud exposure to application compromise**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify cloud exposure points
- Validate exploitability in controlled environments
- Chain cloud weaknesses into application-level impact
- Demonstrate realistic attacker behavior
- Produce professional penetration testing reports

---

## 📐 Scope

### In Scope
- Cloud exposure discovery
- Web & API penetration testing
- Identity and authorization abuse
- Privilege escalation
- Attack path chaining
- Reporting & remediation guidance

### Out of Scope
- Production systems
- Zero-day research
- Malware development
- Persistence mechanisms

---

## 🧠 Methodology

1. Cloud exposure discovery  
2. Initial access validation  
3. Web & API enumeration  
4. Privilege escalation  
5. Attack path chaining  
6. Reporting & remediation

---

## 🔒 Ethics

All testing is conducted in **controlled, non-production environments** for academic and educational purposes.
