# Major Project – Cloud Exposure to Application Compromise

## 📌 Project Title
**Cloud Exposure to Application Compromise: Attack Path Discovery and Exploitation Framework**

---

## 🧭 Project Status
🚧 **In Progress**  
(Current phase: architecture design and attack path modeling)

---

## 🔍 Motivation
Modern cloud-hosted applications are frequently compromised not through traditional web vulnerabilities alone, but via **cloud exposure**, such as:

- Publicly exposed cloud resources
- Leaked access tokens and credentials
- Over-privileged identities
- Weak identity and access control boundaries

This project aims to simulate **real-world attacker behavior**, focusing on **attack path discovery** rather than isolated vulnerability identification.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Identify cloud exposure points linked to web and API applications
- Simulate realistic penetration testing workflows
- Chain cloud misconfigurations into application-level compromise
- Demonstrate security and business impact
- Produce professional penetration testing reports

---

## 📐 Scope

### ✔ In Scope
- Cloud exposure discovery (assets, secrets, identities)
- Web and REST API penetration testing
- Authentication & authorization abuse
- Privilege escalation and attack chaining
- Professional reporting and remediation guidance

### ❌ Out of Scope
- Testing of real production systems
- Zero-day vulnerability research
- Malware development or persistence mechanisms

---

## 🧠 Methodology Overview
The framework follows a structured attack path approach:

1. Cloud exposure discovery  
2. Initial access validation  
3. Web & API enumeration  
4. Privilege escalation and abuse  
5. Attack path chaining  
6. Reporting and remediation

---

## 🏗️ Planned Architecture
- Attacker environment for controlled penetration testing
- Cloud-backed web application with REST APIs
- Simulated cloud services for storage and identity
- Logging and evidence collection
- Reporting module for structured findings

---

## 🛠️ Technologies (Planned)
- Python
- Flask (Web Application)
- REST APIs
- Simulated cloud services
- Custom testing scripts
- HTML / PDF reporting

---

## 🚀 Expected Outcomes
- Demonstration of realistic cloud-to-application attack paths
- Strong understanding of modern penetration testing methodology
- Industry-aligned penetration testing documentation
- Foundation for advanced red team skill development

---

## 🔒 Ethical Note
All testing will be conducted in **controlled environments** strictly for academic and educational purposes.
