# CPTS Journey

This section documents my preparation for the **Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS)** certification.

I intentionally document **only high-impact concepts** that reflect real-world penetration testing practices.

## 📌 Focus Areas

- Active Directory attack paths
- Linux & Windows privilege escalation
- Web & API attack chains
- Penetration testing documentation & reporting

Content will be added progressively as understanding deepens.
